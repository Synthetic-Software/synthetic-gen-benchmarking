The problem statement explicitly requires that both scripts use the same seaborn theme, which is precisely what the patch does.\n\n**Logical Solution:**\n- The solution logically applies a straightforward change from one theme to another, fulfilling the need for visual consistency and does so effectively by directly modifying the theme setting.\n\n**Brevity And Cleanliness Of Code:**\n- The code changes are minimal and focus solely on altering the theme setting. This makes the solution both clean and brief.\n\n**Potential Bugs Generated:**\n- There are no potential bugs introduced by this patch because it only modifies the styling theme, which does not interfere with the functional logic of the plots nor with data manipulation in Seaborn.\n\n### Checklist Evaluation:\n\n1. **Ensure that the same theme is applied using `sns.set_theme()` in both scripts.**\n   - The patch addresses this checklist item by applying `sns.set_theme(style=\"white\")` in both scripts, scoring 1.\n\n2. **Align color palettes using Seaborn's palette options to maintain consistency.**\n   - The patch does not address color palettes; hence, this scores 0. This could lead to inconsistencies if the color palettes between the scripts are distinct.\n\n3. **Standardize marginal histogram styles, including bin sizes and alpha values, between the plots.**\n   - The patch does not address these differences. There might be stylistic inconsistencies in marginal elements, so this scores 0.\n\n4. **Validate plots visually to confirm that changes do not alter their functional aspect or introduce errors.**\n   - The README indicates that plots were verified for functionality and visual consistency, scoring 1.\n\n5. **Document the uniform styling choice in the script's docstring.**\n   - The patch lacks documentation in each script's docstring regarding the uniform styling choice, leaving it unaddressed and leading to a score of 0."
